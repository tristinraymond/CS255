**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
The DriverPass project is a system designed for a client who wanted to help students better prepare for their driving tests. This initiative was taken after noticing that the DMV severely lacked the hands-on style of teaching for new drivers. The client wanted to provide an online platform for students to schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, and track their progress while progressing their way towards their driver's license. Being an online system, the system needed to be able to combine administrative tools for learning with the students' scheduling and course material features. 

**What did you do particularly well?**
I think that I did a good job designing and developing the UML diagrams in this project. I know that I started out pretty rocky with them, and my first ones were not exactly proper, but after some practice, I ended up with some very clear and descriptive UML diagrams that I think would hold up in a real-world setting. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
If I were to go back and revise some of my work on these documents, I would pick some of the earlier UML diagrams. Since I have a much better understanding of them now, I think fixing my earliest ones would go a long way and benefit the project the most. I would expand the relationship between the users in the diagram and consider even more interactions between users than just simple system access. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
The main thing I focused on when interpreting the user's needs was making sure that their system had the materials to teach students to drive. Above all else, this seemed to be at the core of their desires. I wanted the client to be able to fulfill their needs, and I felt that sometimes even the simplest goals can have the most meaning. Considering the needs of a client is extremely important, as it is the main reason that the client hired us in the first place. Without solving the issue that the client has, we have essentially never even left square one, and did a ton of work for no reason at all. 

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
When designing software, I like to start by understanding the requirements and the goal of the project. With just these two things, I feel that the rest of the project kind of falls into place. On top of this, I feel that talking to the client directly is extremely helpful as it allows me to ask questions that may never have been thought of by the client. In the future, I'd like to implement more prototyping for systems, since I feel I have much to learn in that area.
